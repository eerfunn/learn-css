display

- A lot of element in html have type of either block element or inline element
- to put it simple, block element using the concept of the box, and take 100% of it's parent available width, hence why the next element will be moved to the next line
- meanwhile, inline element only used "enough" space for it's content, so it wont take it's whole parent's width
- You can mix both of them by using "display:inline-block", to avoid overflowed attribute from inline element in a block element, it'll resized it's block level element based on it's inline element attribute too
