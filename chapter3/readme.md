# Chapter 3: CSS Colors

Summary:

- background is short version of background-color
- When you deciding which color to use for background and font, you should consider if it's easy and comfortable to read(readibility, accessbility, contrast, etc) by user
- There's few ways to write color (color name, hexadecimal/#FFFFFF, rgb(0,0,0), and rgba(0,0,0,0.5))
- rgb stands for red, green, blue, while rgba stands for red, green, blue, alpha, the alpha variable is used to change the transparency
- when you selecting the color manually from css color pallete, there's "hsl" variable which stands for hue(color wheel references from 0 degree to 360 degree), saturation (100% full color, 0% gray/white), and lightness (100% white, 0% black)
- Additional notes: If you need color references, you can always go to color pallete website and find the color that you like!
