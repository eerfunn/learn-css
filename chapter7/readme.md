- You can adjust your link with CSS to your needs, wheteher it for navbar and deleting its underline, change its color to make it fit with theme, and much more
- You can also use anchor pseudoclasses to adjust your link
- Anchor pseudoclasses has more priority, so it'll overwrite element selector / normal anchor style
